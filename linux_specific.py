# Clipboard
# --------------------------

# Currently, we're inheriting the wxPython clipboard routines from
# generic_os, but feel free to add an implementation here that doesn't
# require wxWindows (if one exists).

# --------------------------
# Key bindings
# --------------------------

# We need to guarantee that keybindings are set appropriately.
# We here establish some accessible constants that key.py will
# call when establishing keybindings.

# Before launching Archy, we need to swap the caps lock and left super
# keys.  Due to the way SDL interprets the caps lock key, it would
# require patching SDL to recognize key-up/key-down events from the caps
# lock key properly.  Because this is cumbersome, we'll instead use
# xmodmap to make the OS think that the caps lock key is the left super
# key while Archy is running (SDL recognizes keyup/keydown events from
# the left super key properly).

# In the future, this process will hopefully be more robust, so that
# Archy can accomplish it without running xmodmap, and so that the key
# mappings can be swapped to their appropriate settings whenever the
# window manager's focus moves in and out of Archy.

# Also note that if you have some kind of xmodmap mapping already in
# place that manipulates the caps lock or left super keys, you may have
# to modify the __XMODMAP_SCRIPT variable below for the key-switching to
# properly occur.

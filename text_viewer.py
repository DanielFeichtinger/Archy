# ARCHY TEXT VIEWER AND DISPLAY MANAGEMENT

# The text_view.TextViewer class manages a linked list of lines (line.Line objects). Each line corresponds to a line of text that can be displayed on the screen. Lines are composed of a list of glyphs. Each glyph corresponds to a single entry in the text array as well as a "character" on the screen.

# In addition to the list of lines, the TextViewer maintains indexes that link glyphs with specific text positions. The indexes are used to map between the glyphs and the text contents. These variables are :

# -firstGlyphPosition
# -firstScreenPosition
# -lastScreenPosition
# -lastGlyphPosition

# Other data that the TextViewer maintains is the Y positions of each of the visible lines and a reference to the line object that corresponds to the top displayed line on the screen.

# The TextViewer descendent classes HumaneDocumentTextViewer and CommandMessageViewer participate in MVC (or Observer) design patterns where HumaneDocumentText or CommandMessageText objects are Model(M) objects and a TextViewer is a View(V). The TextViewers have onAddText and onDelText methods that are called when text is added and deleted from the document.

# --- --- ---
# The Mapping Between the Lines and the Display
# --- --- ---

# While Archy is running, there will be at least as many lines of glyphs managed by the text viewer as there are displayed on the screen.

# A fresh screen is drawn by the method :

# - TextViewer.regenerateTextAroundCursor(self,pos).

# The lines of glyphs are generated one paragraph at a time. A paragraph is a range text that is terminated by a new line character (end of paragraph). The position in text of the first glyph of the first line in the linked list is firstGlyphPosition and the position of the last glyph in the linked is lastGlyphPosition.

# Because the lines are generated a paragraph at a time, the first glyph position and last glyph position will usually be outside the screen. Within the range (firstGlyphPosition .. lastGlyphPosition) there will be a range defined by (firstScreenPosition .. lastScreenPosition) that delimits the glyphs that are on the screen. 

# - firstGlyphPosition <= firstScreenPosition <= lastScreenPosition <= lastGlyphPosition

# After the lines are generated, and firstScreenPosition is valid, the method:

# - TextViewer.calcVisibleLineInfo() 

# can calculate the lastScreenPosition and lineYPositions correctly.

# --- --- ---
# Mapping the glyphs to the actual display screen
# --- --- ---

# The TextViewer.calcVisibleLineInfo() method will produce a Python map data structure TextViewer.lineYPosition which can be used to correctly calculate the rectangle dimensions of the rectangle that is covered by any glyph that is on the screen.

# --- --- ---
# Constraints on the Text Viewer's data
# --- --- ---

# The firstGlyphPosition and firstScreenPosition will always map to the 0th glyphs on their lines. lastScreenPosition and lastGlyphPosition will always map to the last glyphs on their lines. 

# Any change to the set of glyphs must keep the values of firstGlyphPosition, firstScreenPosition, lastScreenPosition, and lastGlyphPosition in synch with the text contents. Furthermore, the following conditions must be true on after any modification to the glyphs.

# - (firstGlyphPosition - 1) indexes a new line character.
# - topLine references a valid line and is not None.
# - the firstScreenPosition maps to the glyph at offset 0 on the topLine
# - the lastScreenPosition is adjusted properly with a call to calcVisibleLineInfo if the firstScreenPosition has been modified.
# - lastGlyphPosition indexes a new line character unless it indexes the last character of the document.

# If the conditions for the firstGlyphPosition and lastGlyphPosition are not true (e.g., the new line character preceding the firstGlyphPosition is deleted) regenerateTextAroundCursor() must be called to refresh the set of glyphs.

# --- --- ---
# Mapping Functions between glyphs and text position and screen position
# --- --- ---

# If the text positions mapping to the first and last glyph and first and last screen characters are correct, the there are methods can be used to calculate the line,offset of a text position if it is within the range (firstGlyphPosition..lastGlyphPosition). Other methods can map the other direction and find the text position of a valid line,offset value.

# - TextViewer.textPosToLinePos( self, textPos)
# Return the line, offset that corresponds to the textPos if the textPos is within (firstGlyphPosition..lastGlyphPosition). Returns None, -1 if the textPos is outside the range of glyphs.

# - TextViewer.movePos (self, line, linePos, delta)
# Returns a (line, offset) that represents a move of delta from the glyph referenced by (line, linePos). delta < 0 indicates a move backwards and 0 < delta indicated a move forward.

# -TextViewer.linePosToTextPos( self, line, offset)
# Returns the text position of (line,offset).

# -TextViewer.TextPosToScreenLinePos(self, textPos)
# If the textPos is within the bounds [firstScreenPosition..lastScreenPosition], return the (line,offset). The line will have an entry in the Python map data type lineYPositions and together with the widths of the glyphs, the rectangle position of a glyph on the screen can be calculated.

# --- --- ---
# onAddText and onDelText and rewrapping of the lines
# --- --- ---

# The contents of the set of glyphs can be changed to match additions and deletions in the documents that the TextViewer observes. Adding and deleting text also affects the word wrapping and therefore reorganizes the new set of glyphs into new sets of lines.

# The firstGlyphPosition, firstScreenPosition, lastScreenPosition and lastGlyphPosition indexes must be kept synchronized with the changes. Certain changes, such as deleting the newline character that precedes the firstGlyphPosition, can require a call to regenerateTextAroundCursor to refresh the glyphs from scratch. At the time onAddText and onDelText are called, the cursor position is not stable so the onAddText and onDelText return with calls to._clearContent(). This will clear the glyphs. When the screen is redrawn (in the current design, this will be after the new cursor position is set) the lack of glyphs will trigger a call to regenerateTextAroundCursor().

# An overview of the commands module
# --------------------------

# All user actions are represented by Command objects.

# Command objects have properties:

# - name()
# - recordable()

# Command objects have the methods:

# - execute()
# - undo()
# - redo()

# A commandMap holds all the commands that the user 
# can initiate. Command objects that are not in the 
# commandMap can be used from other parts of the system(including
# other command objects), but can not be run by the user from
# the command quasimode.

# The AddText and DeleteText are examples of Command objects that will
# be run from key.py but are not available to the command quasimode.

# The commandHistory holds a list of previously executed command objects.
# By calling commandHistory[last].undo() the last action can be undone.

# --------------------------
# The Command Object Abstract Class

I am worried, though, that if we do not have this default to the normally correct value, programming in Archy will start to seem like having to program in Java-- a lot of unnecessary house work that needs to be completed before one gets down to business.

# The Command Map
# --------------------------

# Command names that are registered with commandObject subclass instances through registerCommand() can be run from the command quasimode even without runnable modules in the text.    These commands form a core of primitives.

# An alternative design to consider when the "Programming in Archy" specifications are fully implemented is to define the core commands as modules in the same manner as the user defined commands. Even the core commands will be defined within the text of Archy rather than as outside files.

# The following function registers a Command object with the Command Map.

# Suppose a user executes 4 commands. The commandHistory is [A, B, C, D] where A B C and D are the respective commands. The last command is D.

# If the user undo()es 3 commands D.undo(), C.undo, B.undo() the command history is now
# [A, B`, C`, D`] with the A being the last command. B` C` D` represent commands that were undo()ne and are redoable.

# The user redo()es B` and the command history is how [A, B, C` D`] with B being the last command.

# If at this point, the user executes command E, the history becomes [ A, B, E ]. The commands C` and D` are no longer redo()-able since the context where they occurred (after
# commands A and B) is no longer valid.

# A problem with this design is that once the command history becomes [A, B, E] it is impossible to revert to the state [A, B, C`, D`]. Alternative designs will be considered in the future.

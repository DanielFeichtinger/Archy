# EXPLANATION OF ARCHY BMH(Boyer Moore Horspool) pattern matching.

# An excellent explanation and C++ implementation of the fast string search method can be found at the web site:

# http://www.glenmccl.com/bmh.htm

# SPEED ISSUES

# Currently, the efficiency of this code is improved by a factor of about 25 when Psyco is used to accelerate it.

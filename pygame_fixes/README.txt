PYGAME FIXES FOR ARCHY
----------------------

Hopefully, this directory will only be temporary.

At the time of this writing (4/18/2005), the Pygame library is in a
bit of a state of flux; the regular maintainer, Pete Shinners, is MIA,
and other pygame developers have started maintaining a new version of
the Pygame library in his absence.  The fixes in this directory have
already been (or will in the near future be) applied to the new
version of the Pygame library.  However, the code repository for this
new version of the Pygame library, and exactly what other
patches/improvements have been applied to it, is not entirely clear,
so this directory contains some files based off the standard Pygame
1.6 distribution.

Unlike standard diff patches, we're just including the affected files
verbatim here; to apply the fixes contained here, just copy any
files in this directory into your Pygame directory (usually in
lib/site-packages/pygame).

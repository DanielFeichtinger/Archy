# The Line Class
# --------------------------

# The Line class represents a physical line on the screen; it does not represent a paragraph of text, which has sometimes historically been referred to as a "line".

# The class maintains within it:

# - a list of glyphs
# - a margin (distance from left edge to start rendering).
# - a height (which is the maximum of the glyph heights).
# - a width (which is the pixel width of the line).
# - a length (which is the number of characters on the line).

# '__init__' creates an empty Line, with a height and margin of 0, and the given
# TextViewer parent.

# This module represents code and data for Archy that can change
# depending on the particular platform (operating system and hardware)
# the program is running on.  Intrinsically, this module contains no
# such code and data, but instead serves as a "proxy" for other modules
# that contain platform-specific code and data.

# --------------------------
# Module initialization
# --------------------------

# First, the entire namespace from the generic_os module is imported
# into this module.  Think of generic_os as a module that contains the
# default, or "base" platform-specific code and data.

from generic_os import *

# Now, the platform's identity is determined.  If a module
# containing platform-specific data exists for the platform, that
# module's namespace is then imported into this module.

# In effect, all platforms "inherit" from the generic_os module, so a
# platform-specific module only need contain information that overrides
# the default information contained in generic_os.

import platform
current_os = platform.system()

if current_os in ["Windows", "Microsoft Windows"]:
    from win_specific import *
elif current_os == "Darwin":
    from mac_specific import *
elif current_os == "Linux":
    from linux_specific import *

# Now we need to use the current definitions to pre-generate some other definitions that Archy needs. (Yes, this is a bad hack.)

# We need to find a way to reverse-map the name of a key to its virtual key code.  Pygame doesn't offer a function to do this, so we'll use the brute-force approach.

# Note that if a key code can't be found for the given keybinding, this function returns None; this may cause errors later on in Archy, but this is preferable to raising an exception, because we don't want the importing of this module to raise an exception.
